    "content": "The PEDSnet Common Data Model is an evolving specification, based in structure on the OMOP Common Data Model, but expanded to accommodate requirements of both the PCORnet Common Data Model and the primary research cohorts established in PEDSnet.\n\nVersion 2 of the PEDSnet CDM reflects the ETL processes developed after the first six months of network development. As such, it proposes to align with version 2 of the PCORnet CDM.\n\nThis document provides the ETL processing assumptions and conventions developed by the PEDSnet data partners that should be used by a data partner for ensuring common ETL business rules. This document will be modified as new situations are identified, incorrect business rules are identified and replaced, as new analytic use cases impose new/different ETL rules, and as the PEDSnet CDM continues to evolve.\n\nComments on this specification and ETL rules are welcome. Please send email to pedsnetdcc@email.chop.edu, or contact the PEDSnet project management office (details available via http://www.pedsnet.info).\n\n#### PEDSnet Data Standards and Interoperability Policies:\n\n1. The PEDSnet data network will store data using structures compatible with the PEDSnet Common Data Model (PCDM).\n\n2. The PCDM v2 is based on the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data model, version 5. \n\n3. A subset of data elements in the PCDM will be identified as principal data elements (PDEs). The PDEs will be used for population-level queries. Data elements which are NOT PDEs will be marked as Optional (ETL at site discretion) or Non-PDE (ETL required, but data need not be transmitted to DCC), and will not be used in queries without prior approval of site.\n\n4. It is anticipated that PEDSnet institutions will make a good faith attempt to obtain as many of the data elements not marked as Optional as possible.\n\n5. The data elements classified as PDEs and those included in the PCDM will be approved by the PEDSnet Executive Committee (comprised of each PEDSnet institution's site principal investigator).\n\n6. Concept IDs are taken from OMOP 5 vocabularies for PEDSnet CDM v2, using the complete (restricted) version that includes licensed terminologies such as CPT and others.\n\n7. PCORnet CDM V2.0 requires data elements that are not currently considered \"standard concepts\". Vocabulary version 5 has a new vocabulary (vocabulary_id=PCORNet) that was added by OMOP to capture all of the PCORnet concepts that are not in the standard terminologies. We use concept_ids from vocabulary_id=PCORNet where there are no existing standard concepts. We highlight where we are pulling concept_ids from vocabulary_id=PCORNet in the tables. While terms from vocabulary_id=PCORNet violates the OMOP rule to use only concept_ids from standard vocabularies vocabulary_id=PCORNet is a non-standard vocabulary), this convention enables a clean extraction from PEDSnet CDM to PCORnet CDM.\n\n8. Some source fields may be considered sensitive by data sites. Potential examples include patient_source_value, provider_source_value, care_site_source_value. Many of these fields are used to generate an ID field, such as PERSON.patient_source_value PERSON.person_id, that is used as a primary key in PERSON and a foreign key in many other tables. Sites are free to obfuscate or not provide source values that are used to create ID variables. Sites must maintain a mapping from the ID variable back to the original site-specific value for local re-identification tasks.\n\n    1. Source fields that contain clinical data, such as source condition occurrence, should be included\n\n    2. The PEDSnet DCC will never release source values to external data partners.\n\n    3. Source value obfuscation techniques may include replacing the real source value with a random number, an encrypted derivative value/string, or some other site-specific algorithm.\n\n9. Regarding the nullability of all source value (string) fields only, the PEDSnet CDM will accommodate the following values, taken from the PCORnet CDM:\n\nNull Name | Definition of each field\n --- | ---\nNULL | A data field is not present in the source system. Note. This is not a 'NULL' string but the NULL value.\n'NI' = No Information | A data field is present in the source system, but the source value is null or blank\n'UN' = Unknown | A data field is present in the source system, but the source value explicitly denotes an unknown value\n'OT' = Other | A data field is present in the source system, but the source value cannot be mapped to the CDM\n\n***ETL Recommendation:*** Due to PK/FK constraints, the most efficient order for ETL table is location, care_site, provider, person, visit_occurrence, condition_occurrence, observation, procedure_occurrence,measurement,drug exposure and observation_period\n\nIt is recommended to refer to the vocabulary documentation as provided by ODHSII for guidance on how to populate \"concept_id\" fields in the model and for any specific transformations in the vocabulary. http://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=documentation:vocabulary:data_etl\n\n* * *\n## Table of Contents\n####[1.1 Person](Pedsnet_CDM_V2_OMOPV5_ETL_Conventions.md#11-person-1)\n\n####[1.2 Death](Pedsnet_CDM_V2_OMOPV5_ETL_Conventions.md#12-death-1)\n\n####[1.3 Location](Pedsnet_CDM_V2_OMOPV5_ETL_Conventions.md#13-location-1)\n\n####[1.4 Caresite](Pedsnet_CDM_V2_OMOPV5_ETL_Conventions.md#14-care_site)\n\n####[1.5 Provider](Pedsnet_CDM_V2_OMOPV5_ETL_Conventions.md#15-provider-1)\n\n####[1.6 Visit Occurrence ](Pedsnet_CDM_V2_OMOPV5_ETL_Conventions.md#16-visit_occurrence)\n\n####[1.7 Condition Occurrence](Pedsnet_CDM_V2_OMOPV5_ETL_Conventions.md#17-condition_occurrence)\n\n####[1.8 Procedure Occurrence](Pedsnet_CDM_V2_OMOPV5_ETL_Conventions.md#18-procedure_occurrence)\n\n####[1.9 Observation](Pedsnet_CDM_V2_OMOPV5_ETL_Conventions.md#19-observation-1)\n\n####[1.10 Observation Period](Pedsnet_CDM_V2_OMOPV5_ETL_Conventions.md#110-observation-period-1)\n\n####[1.11 Drug Exposure](Pedsnet_CDM_V2_OMOPV5_ETL_Conventions.md#111-drug-exposure-draft)\n\n####[1.12 Measurement](Pedsnet_CDM_V2_OMOPV5_ETL_Conventions.md#112-measurement-draft)\n\n####[1.13 Fact Relationship](Pedsnet_CDM_V2_OMOPV5_ETL_Conventions.md#113-fact-relationship-1)\n\n####[1.14 Visit Payer](Pedsnet_CDM_V2_OMOPV5_ETL_Conventions.md#114-visit_payer)\n\n####[Appendix] (Pedsnet_CDM_V2_OMOPV5_ETL_Conventions.md#a1-abms-specialty-category-to-omop-v5-specialty-mapping)\n\n* * *",

If sites have any information on this filed in the source EHR then these fields should be populated in the PEDSnet CDM instance**\n\n#### 1.7.1 Additional Notes\n\n- The 1/1/2009 date limitation that is used to define a PEDSnet active patient is \\*\\*NOT\\*\\* applied to condition_occurrence. All conditions are included for an active patient. For PEDSnet CDM V2, we limit condition_occurrences to final diagnoses only (not reason-for-visit and provisional surgical diagnoses such as those recored in EPIC OPTIME). In EPIC, final diagnoses includes both encounter diagnoses and billing diagnoses, problem lists (all problems, not filtered on \"chronic\" versus \"provisional\" unless local practices use this flag as intended). Medical History diagnosis are optional.\n- Condition records are inferred from diagnostic codes recorded in the source data by a clinician or abstractionist for a specific visit. In the current version of the CDM, diagnoses extracted from unstructured data (such as notes) are not included.\n- Source code systems, like ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM, etc., provide coverage of conditions. However, if the code does not define a condition, but rather is an observation or a procedure, then such information is not stored in the CONDITION_OCCURRENCE table, but in the respective tables instead. An example are ICD-9-CM procedure codes. For example, OMOP source-to-concept table uses the MAPPING_TYPE column to distinguish ICD9 codes that represent procedures rather than conditions.\n- Condition source values are mapped to standard concepts for cflowonditions in the Vocabulary. Since the icd9-cm diagnosis codes are notB in the concept table, use the source_to_concept_map table where the icd9_code = source_code and the source_vocabulary_id =ICD9CM (icd_9) and target_vocabulatory_id=SNOMED (snomed-ct) to locate the correct condition_concept_id value.\n- When the source code cannot be translated into a Standard Concept, a CONDITION_OCCURRENCE entry is stored with only the corresponding source_value and a condition_concept_id of 0.\n- Codes written in the process of establishing the diagnosis, such as \"question of\" of and \"rule out\", are not represented here.",

The temporally most recent observation will be used to determine the current consent status.\n\n**Note 3:** Discharge disposition and discharge status appear only once per visit_occurence. These vales can change across different visit_occurrences. Use the visit_occurrence_id to tie these observations to the corresponding visit.\n\n**Note 4:** If tobacco information is available at the visit level, please provide this information.
